    <dd>I took a black cat, a cave bat, and threw them in a pot pot <br>
            Pot pot, pot pot <br>
I took a blue snake, a green snake, and tied them in a knot knot <br>
Knot knot, knot knot <br>
I took a hog jaw, a dog's paw, and hung them on the line line <br>
Line line, line line <br>
I took a horse hair, a green pear, and made a crazy sign sign <br>
Sign sign, sign sign <br>
<br>
I'm castin' my spell on you, I'm castin' my spell on you <br>
I'm castin' my spell on you, you'll never never be untrue <br>
<br>
I took a goat's tooth, an old shoe, and put them in the ground ground <br>
Ground ground, ground ground <br>
I took an old dish, a dry fish, and made a crazy sound sound <br>
Sound sound, sound sound <br>
I took a goose egg, a frog leg, and hid them in a sack sack <br>
Sack sack, sack sack <br>
I got a Hindu, to tattoo, a genii on my back back <br>
Back back, back back <br>

I'm castin' my spell on you, I'm castin' my spell on you <br>
I'm castin' my spell on you, you'll never never be untrue <br>

          <br>
          <dd>I was a teenage werewolf <br>
Braces on my fangs <br>
I was a teenage werewolf <br>
And no one even said thanks <br>
And no one made me stop <br>
<br>
I had a teen-land mind <br>
I had to blow my top <br>
And under teen full moon <br>
No one could make me stop <br>
No one could make me stop <br>
<br>
A teenage werewolf <br>
Parallel bars <br>
A teenage girlfriend <br>
Got a lot of scars <br>
Somebody please make me stop <br>
Ohhh please… <br>
<br>
You know, I have puberty rights <br>
And I have puberty wrongs <br>
No one understood me <br>
All my teeth were so long <br>
And no one made me stop <br>
<br>
A Midwest monster <br>
Of the highest grade <br>
All my teachers thought <br>
It was growing pains, oh no no <br>
Somebody stop this pain, ohhh…</dd>

The ghosts will spook <br>
The spooks will scare <br>
Why, even Dracula will be there <br>

It's time for games <br>
It's time for fun <br>
Not for just one <br>
But for everyone <br>
<br>
The jack-o-lanterns are all lit up <br>
All the dummies are made and stuffed <br>
By just looking you will see <br>
It's this time of year again <br>
<br>
It's Halloween <br>
It's Halloween <br>
 <br>
All the kids are happy and gay <br>
There doesn't seem to be a cloud in their way <br>
But when it's over and they've had all their fun <br>
They'll wish that Halloween had just begun <br>
  <br>

Oh, there are witches, goblins, vampires, devils, Frankensteins and zombies <br>
And there are tramps, Cinderellas, pirates, angels and gypsies <br>
So let's have lots of fun and give many cheers <br>
For Halloween comes but once a year <br>
 <br>
It's time for games <br>
It's time for fun <br>
Not for just one <br>
But for everyone <br>

          <br>
          <dd>Coming on the night train <br>
With an arm full of box cars <br>
On the wings of a magpie, 'cross a hooligan night <br>
Busted up a chifforobe <br>
Way out by the cocomo <br>
Cooked up a mess a mulligan and got into a fight <br>
<br>
Whistlin' past the graveyard <br>
Steppin' on a crack <br>
I'm a mean motherhubbard <br>
Papa one eyed jack <br>
<br>
You probably seen me sleepin' out by the railroad tracks <br>
Ask the prince of darkness 'bout the smoke from the stack <br>
Sometimes I kill a jackal and suck out all the blood <br>
Steal myself a station-wagon, drive it into the mud <br>
<br>
Whistlin' past the graveyard <br>
Steppin' on a crack <br>
I'm a mean motherhubbard <br>
Papa one eyed jackbr  <br>
<br>
I know you've seen my headlights and the honkin' of my horn <br>
I'm callin' out my bloodhounds chase the devil out the corn <br>
I was born in a taxi cab I ain't never goin' home <br>

<br>
Whistlin' past the graveyard <br>
Steppin' on a crack <br>
I'm a mean motherhubbard <br>
Papa one eyed jack <br>

<br>
My eyes have seen the glory <br>
Of the drainin' of the ditch <br>
<br>
I'm comin' to Baton Rouge <br>
To find myself a witch <br>
I'm gonna switch me up a couple of 'em every time it rains <br>
You gotta see a locomotive <br>
Probably thinkin' it's a train <br>

<br>
Whistlin' past the graveyard <br>
Steppin' on a crack <br>
I'm a mean motherhubbard <br>
Papa one eyed jack <br>

<br>
What you think is sunshine <br>
Is just a twinkle in my eye <br>
I got a ring around my finger called the 4th of July <br>
When I get lonesome, a tear falls from my cheek <br>
There's gonna be an ocean in the middle of the week <br>
 <br>


Whistlin' past the graveyard <br>
Steppin' on a crack <br>
I'm a mean motherhubbard <br>
Papa one eyed jack <br>
<br>
I come in on the night train <br>
With an arm full of box cars <br>
On the wings of a magpie <br>
Cross a hooligan night <br>

I'm gonna tear off a rainbow <br>
And wear it for a tie <br>
I never told the truth <br>
So how in the hell can I tell a lie <br>

Whistlin' past the graveyard <br>

          <dt>Bobby "Boris" Pickett & The Crypt-Kickers</dt>
          <br>
          <dd>I was working in the lab, late one night <br>
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight <br>
For my monster from his slab, began to rise <br>
And suddenly to my surprise <br>
<br>
He did the mash, he did the monster mash <br>
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash <br>
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash <br>
He did the mash, he did the monster mash <br>
 <br>
From my laboratory in the castle east <br>
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast <br>
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes <br>
To get a jolt from my electrodes <br>

<br>
They did the mash, they did the monster mash <br>
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash <br>
They did the mash, it caught on in a flash <br>
They did the mash, they did the monster mash <br>
<br>
The Zombies were having fun, the party had just begun <br>
The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son <br>
<br>

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds <br>
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds <br>
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive <br>
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five' <br>

<br>
They played the mash, they played the monster mash <br>
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash <br>
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash <br>
They played the mash, they played the monster mash <br>

<br>
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring <br>
Seems he was troubled by just one thing <br>
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said <br>
"Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist? <br>
<br>
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash <br>
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash <br>
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash <br>
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash <br>
<br>
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band <br>
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land <br>
For you, the living this mash was meant too <br>
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you <br>
<br>
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash <br>
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash <br>
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash <br>
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash</dd>
